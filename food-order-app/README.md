# Food order app - Core

## This app allows you to
- Add food to cart with preferred quantities
- Update items from cart
- Remove items from cart when quantity is less than 1

## What I've practiced:
- `useContext` to store and update cart in multiple components
- `useRef` to access value from DOM elements
- Common functions to work with arrays: `reduce()` , `splice()`
