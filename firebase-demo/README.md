# Firebase and Form validation

This project is to input and retreat data from a database hosted in Firebase, and validate inputs before submitting.

## In this app, I practiced:

- Create and manage Firebase realtime database, using functions like `fetch()`, `.stringtify()`, and `.json()`

- Use Promises in `.then()` and asycn/away

- Validate form inputs onBlur, onKeyStroke and on Submit
